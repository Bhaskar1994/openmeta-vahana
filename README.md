# OpenMETA-Vahana
An OpenMETA model for the conceptual design of an autonomous transport aircraft, inspired by the Vahana Project from A^3 by Airbus. The goal was to replicate the tradeoff study that was released by A^3. A CAD model has been added to supplement this analysis. This model has parametric rotation of the wings and canards, as well as changing total wing and canard length based on the design variable "rProp".
